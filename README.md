# Classifying the MNIST

## Overview

Classifying the MNIST is a Data Science project focused on exploring and implementing the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification method to classify the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).

The goal of this project is to build, fine-tune, and analyze the kNN classification model to achieve accurate and efficient digit recognition. The repository contains code, documentation, and resources related to the kNN classification task.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Explore and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
   - Transform the data into a suitable format for kNN model training.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Implement the kNN classification model.
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

3. **Evaluation and Comparison:**
   - Evaluate the kNN model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Compare and analyze the results obtained using kNN with potential insights into its strengths and weaknesses.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Detailed documentation explaining the rationale behind choosing the kNN model, preprocessing steps, and performance metrics.
   - Results and insights gained from the analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:
